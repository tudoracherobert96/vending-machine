# Vending Machine

We have 2 pages:

1 - the Home page, where we have a screen of products with prices, quantities and a product code, which we use to buy the product. On the right we have a keypad that lets us enter the product code, with buttons from 0 to 9. We also have a Delete and a Pay button, the Delete button clears the input field and the Pay button adds the item to Cart. When an item is bought, over the keypad, the Items number is increased and the Wallet is decreased by the item's worth in lei. If a product is no longer in stock or we don't have money to buy it, we get an allert to buy a valid product. When we click on Items from the keypad, we go into our 2nd page.

2 - the Cart page, that is displaying every item bought(with the Price and the Code), and also a keypad similar to the Home one, that shows the Wallet and 6 buttons to add more money to our Wallet. By clicking on Buy More, we go back to the Home page and we can buy more products.
